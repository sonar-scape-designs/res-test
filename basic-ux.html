                <p>In this assignment we learned the basic principles to develop a responsive website; one which is compatible with various devices, screen sizes and orientation.
                    I applied varies design principles and programming solutions to my responsive site, which include:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Mostly fluid - on smaller screens, the fluid grid causes the main content to reflow, whilecolumns are stacked vertically and the menu changes to hamburger menu placed in the top left corner. </li><br>
                    <li>Multi-column grid:
                        Column grids are used to have control over the different conten. For example, I allocated images to particular area, such as the biggining of the page, for consistenc.</li><br>
                    <li>Media Queries:
                        Media queries are simple filters that can be applied to CSS styles. They make it easy to change styles based on the characteristics of the device rendering the content, including the display type, width, height, orientation, and even resolution. </li> <br>
                    <li>Gestalt principles were applied, to improve the user interface design of the site. These include the use of Similarity, Proximity and Symmetry.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>

                    This assignment has allowed me to understand and apply various principles in design and programming, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The importance of responsive website, to allow the site to be adaptable for various screens and devices; </li> <br>
                    <li>With the use of custom layout Structures, to ensure responsiveness of the page structure. </li> <br>
                    <li>The purpose of media quires, to change the characteristics of elements so they can adapt to different screens
