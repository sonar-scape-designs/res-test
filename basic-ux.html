                <h2>Data Collection</h2>

                <h3> Assignment Focus</h3>
                <p>The data collection assignment provided the opportunity to work with empirical data, utilising desk research, surveys and interviews. The data collected here provided insight to further improve the usability of future websites as well gaining an awareness of the users’ experience, through a think-aloud test.</p>

                <h3> Assigned Role</h3>
                <p>Role
                    During this assignment I undertook the role of the researcher, independently conducting desk research, for secondary information; surveys and interview, to gain first-hand accounts and primary information.
                    The different research methods were conducted under different settings, appropriate to gain the most reliable results.
                </p>
                <h3> Learning Outcome</h3>
                <p>From this assignment, I came to understand the importance of research, especially in the stage prior to development in order to understand the users needs and problems to develop the right solutions. For example:
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Interviews were effective as I had more control and was able to interpret non-verbal communication.</li><br>
                    <li>Surveys increased the amount of respondents to reach, however response rate were relatively low. This emphasised that surveys can be more effective conducted in collaboration with other research methods.</li>

                </ul>

            </li>

                <h3>Assignment Objective</h3>
                <p>During this assignment, the task was to develop prototypes, working with both high and low fidelity in order to meet the needs of a target audience, taking into consideration the perspective of the sender and the needs of the reciever.

                <h3>Assigned Role</h3>
                <p>Working in pairs, my role during this task was to facilitate the coordination of activities, conduct interviews and co-develop the high-fidelity solution. </p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
                <p>From this assignment I came to understand the benefits of utilising hi-fidelity prototypes and their ability to gain real user insights through different testing methods, such as the think-aloud test. Therefore, developing the prototype within Adobe XD allowed us to simulate the final product to test for the flow, design appeal and the overall user experience prior to developing the final solution.
                    <br>
                    In addition, consider the sender and reciever, this assignent gave me the opportunity to consider the use copywriting whereby we utilised a friendly and informative tone in our prototype.

                <h3>Assignment Objective</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Sprint assignment, working in collaboration with other students, the purpose was to ultimately create a clickable prototype for a native app.
                    The app was designed to serve a specific need for current students, to which my group and I developed an app called Bridge a peer-to-peer knowledge and skill exchange service.
                    <br><br>
                    The Bridge’s main function is to bring people together. It is based on an “Offer/Need” system. Your profile, when completed will have the lists of all the skills you can teach (offer) and all the skills you want to learn (need).
                </p>
                <h3>Assigned Role</h3>
                <p>During this assignment, my role included contributing and participating in development of the app, specifically by conducting primary research on our lo-fidelity version to our target audience and presenting our final solution. </p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
                <p>From this assignment I came to understand the importance of identifying the target audience and their problems alongside conducting user-tests to identify suitable solutions, unique to the current market.
                    For example, my group and I interviewed experts, which we considered to be lecturers and senior students, to gain different perspectives and feedback towards our idea.
                    <br><br>

                    In addition, highlighting both long-term goals and potential challenges established expectations and allowed us to create clear time frames. The overall idea received positive feedback; however, there were questions raised in regard to the implementation and student recruitment of the app.
