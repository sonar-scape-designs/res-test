                <h3> Assignment Focus</h3>
                <p>This assignment introduced greater understanding of html and css and required the development of an animated character, coded using css, displayed on a personally designed background. The purpose of this assignment was to broaden my understanding of html, but specifically the capabilities of css and to demonstrate my understanding through character design and story telling techniques. </p>


                <h3> Assigned Role</h3>
                <p>For this assignment I undertook several tasks:</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Researching inspiration to develop a unique character and story</li><br>
                    <li>Sketch several ideas, adopting inspiration from the gathered resources</li><br>
                    <li>
                        Illustrate the final character and design a background suitable for the chosen storyboard
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Programme the illustration, utilising appropriate CSS syntax and apply the animation sprite.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
                <p>The learning outcome of this assignment includes gaining a greater understanding of: </p>
                <ul><br>
                    <li>
                        Mopboards, and their ability to direct the focus towards specific design element. The use of the mood board allowed me to understand the colour, texture, common themes and overall perception of my chosen character style.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Animation principles were used within my assignment, specifically the pose-to-pose technique to ensure each frame of my character movement felt natural.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Illustrator abilities to design characters, whereby I utilised the trace feature to lock layers of my sketches onto various storyboards.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Assignment Focus</h3>
                <p>Utilising JavaScript, this assignment required our character to animate in various positions. The purpose of this assignment is to gain a greater understanding of JavaScript and its abilities to control the behaviour of an element.

                </p>


                <h3> Assigned Role</h3>
                <p>My role in this assignment was to develop my initial character, animated in css, however to utilise JavaScript statements in order to run particular animated actions.</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Researching inspiration to develop a unique character and story</li><br>
                    <li>Sketch several ideas, adopting inspiration from the gathered resources</li><br>
                    <li>
                        Illustrate the final character and design a background suitable for the chosen storyboard
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Programme the illustration, utilising appropriate CSS syntax and apply the animation sprite.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
                <p>I came to understand the use of variables and my ability to assign it a value which I can later use, with a query selector, for various elements.
                    This is demonstrated through the use of sound in my animation buttons, to prompt the user about an action. Here I have assign a variable to a class which I can assign an event listener (function), which will allow me to activate the sound, depending on which action I would like the user to make.

                <p>During this onboarding experience, I gained a greater understanding in team work, storytelling, research, usability and presenting our solution.
                    During the onboarding assignment, my team and I implemented various methods and techniques to complete the task, which included:

                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Conducting research about the potential needs the user may face</li><br>
