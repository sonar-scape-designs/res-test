                <p>In this assignment we learned the basic principles to develop a responsive website; one which is compatible with various devices, screen sizes and orientation.
                    I applied varies design principles and programming solutions to my responsive site, which include:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Mostly fluid on smaller screens. The fluid grid causes the main content to reflow, while columns are stacked vertically and the menu changes to hamburger menu placed in the top left corner. </li><br>
                    <li>Multi-column grids have been used to have greater control over the different content. For example, I have allocated images to a particular area, such as the top of the page, for design appeal and consistency.</li><br>
                    <li>
                        Media queries have been used to change style of the page based on the type of the device being used from the reciever. The purpose of these queries is to account for the display type, width, height, orientation, and resolution of various screens. </li> <br>
                    <li>Gestalt principles were applied, to improve the user interface design of the site. These include the use of Similarity, Proximity and Symmetry.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The importance of responsive website, to allow the site to be adaptable for various screens and devices; </li> <br>
                    <li>With the use of custom layout Structures, to ensure responsiveness of the page structure. </li> <br>
                    <li>The purpose of media quires, to change the characteristics of elements so they can adapt to different screens
